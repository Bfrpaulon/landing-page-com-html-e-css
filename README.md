# CSS Web Developer Training Challenge

This is the repository of my final project from the CSS Web Developer Training course by Digital Innovation One. The project consists of creating a responsive website, using HTML and CSS, with the theme of presenting DIO's CSS track.

## How to run the project?

To run the project, just clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser.

## Project description

The project was developed using the mobile first approach and has a modern and clean layout, with shades of navy blue and complementary colors. The home page consists of a banner with a logo, title, description and call-to-action button for registration. Just below, there is a section with information about the course, divided into three modules. Next, there is a section with a call to transform the world, followed by a section with information about professional challenges that may be faced after completing the course. Finally, the footer features the DIO logo and a link to register on the platform.
